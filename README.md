It acts a intermediary between multiple APIs, providing a single endpoint for all your needs, and is designed to be easily extensible. The project is written in Rust, using the [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) web framework.

```

By default, the service will be available at `http://localhost:8080`, you can change the port by setting an environment variable file named `.env` with the following content:
