## Voidsong

Voidsong is a versatile, self-hosted API aggregator designed to streamline your interaction with various APIs by providing a unified endpoint for all your content needs. Whether you're looking for random images, trivia facts, or jokes. It serves as a reliable intermediary, fetching and delivering content seamlessly from multiple external APIs.

The project is written in Rust, using the [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) web framework.

### Building and Running

You can start the service by building the project and running the binary, with the following command:

> **Note:** Make sure you have Rust installed on your system. You can install it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

```bash
cargo run --release
```

By default, the service will be available at `http://localhost:8080`, you can change the port by setting an environment variable file named `.env` with the following content:

```env
SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1
SERVER_PORT=8080
```

You can run the image using the following command:

```bash
docker run --name voidsong -e SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1 -e SERVER_PORT=9090 -p 9090:9090 ghcr.io/i9ntheory/voidsong:latest
```

If you can't connect to the service on Linux, try passing the `--network=host` flag to the `docker run` command.
